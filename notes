notes

Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
